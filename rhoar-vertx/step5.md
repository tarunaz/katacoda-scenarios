Now that you've logged into OpenShift, let's deploy our new micro-trader Vert.x microservice:

**Build and Deploy**

Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes includes a powerful maven plugin that can take an
existing Eclipse Vert.x application and generate the necessary Kubernetes configuration.

You can also add additional config, like ``src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml``{{open}} which defines
the deployment characteristics of the app (in this case we declare a few environment variables which map our credentials
stored in the secrets file to the application), but OpenShift supports a wide range of [Deployment configuration options](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html) for apps).

Let's add a deployment.yml that will set the system property to use our `config-openshift.json` config.

Create the file by clicking on open ``src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml``{{open}}

Add the following content the the file (by clicking on *Copy to Editor* or copying it in directly):

<pre class="file" data-filename="./src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml" data-target="replace">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ${project.artifactId}
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - env:
            - name: JAVA_OPTIONS
              value: "-Dvertx.profiles.active=openshift -Dvertx.disableDnsResolver=true"

</pre>

We also need to add a route.yml like this:

Create the file by clicking on open ``src/main/fabric8/route.yml``{{open}}

Add the following content by clicking on *Copy to Editor* or copying it in directly:

<pre class="file" data-filename="./src/main/fabric8/route.yml" data-target="replace">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: ${project.artifactId}
spec:
  port:
    targetPort: 8080
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: ${project.artifactId}
</pre>

Build and deploy the project using the following command, which will use the maven plugin to deploy:

`mvn package fabric8:deploy -Popenshift`{{execute T1 interrupt}}

The build and deploy may take a minute or two. Wait for it to complete. You should see a **BUILD SUCCESS** at the
end of the build output.

After the maven build finishes it will take less than a minute for the application to become available.
To verify that everything is started, run the following command and wait for it complete successfully:

`oc rollout status -w dc/cart`{{execute}}

**3. Access the application running on OpenShift**

This sample project includes a simple UI that allows you to access the Inventory API. This is the same
UI that you previously accessed outside of OpenShift which shows the CoolStore inventory. Click on the
[route URL](http://cart-cart.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com)
to access the sample UI.

> You can also access the application through the link on the OpenShift Web Console Overview page.

## Congratulations!

You have deployed the Catalog service as a microservice which in turn calls into the Inventory service to retrieve inventory data.
However, our monolih UI is still using its own built-in services. Wouldn't it be nice if we could re-wire the monolith to use the
new services, **without changing any code**? That's next!
