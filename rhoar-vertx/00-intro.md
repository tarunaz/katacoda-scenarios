In this scenario, you will learn more about Reactive Microservices using [Eclipse Vert.x](https://vertx.io), one of the runtimes included in [Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhoar).

In this scenario we will create a microservice called `QuoteGenerator` The quote generator is a simulator that generates the quotes for 3 fictional companies MacroHard, Divinator, and Black Coat. The market data is published on the Vert.x event bus.  It also publishes an HTTP endpoint to get the current value of the quote. 


>**NOTE:** To simplify the deployment you will deploy all the services in a single Vert.x Server. However the code is 99% the same if we were to deploy these in separate services.

## What is Reactive?
Reactive is an overloaded term these days. The Oxford dictionary defines reactive as “showing a response to a stimulus.” So, reactive software reacts and adapts its behavior based on the stimuli it receives. However, the responsiveness and adaptability promoted by this definition are challenges when programming because the flow of computation isn’t controlled by the programmer but by the stimuli. In this chapter, we are going to see how Vert.x helps you be reactive by combining:
* **Reactive programming** - A development model focusing on the observation of data streams, reacting on changes, and propagating them
* **Reactive system** - An architecture style used to build responsive and robust distributed systems based on asynchronous message-passing

## Why Reactive Microservices?
In previous scenarios you've seen that building a single microservices is not very hard, but the traditional procedural programming style requires developers to control the flow of calls. Reactive microservices can be implemented more like "black boxes" where each service is only responsible for reacting to different events.

The asynchronous behavior or reactive systems will also save resources. In synchronous programming, all request processing including a call to another service is _blocking_. A _non-reactive_ system typically uses threading to achieve concurrency. In a chain of service calls where service A is calling service B that is calling service C, this means that a thread in service A will block while both B and C are processing. Service B will also block a thread while waiting for service C to return. In a complex Microservices Architecture, any single external request might use hundreds of threads. In a reactive system, network calls are typically asynchronous, meaning that requests sent to other services won't block the main thread, resulting in less resource utilization and better performance.

## What is Eclipse Vert.x?

![Local Web Browser Tab](../assets/rhoar-vertx/vertx-logo.png)

Eclipse Vert.x is a reactive toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine that is polyglot (e.g., supports multiple programming languages).
In this session, we will focus on Java, but it is possible to build the same application in JavaScript, Groovy, Ruby, Ceylon, Scala, or Kotlin.

Eclipse Vert.x is event-driven and non-blocking, which means that applications in Vert.x can handle a lot of concurrent requests using a small number of kernel threads. 

* Vert.x lets your app scale with minimal hardware.
* Vert.x is incredibly flexible - whether it's network utilities, sophisticated modern web applications, HTTP/REST microservices, high volume event processing or a full-blown back-end message-bus application, Vert.x is a great fit.
* Vert.x is used by many [different companies](http://vertx.io/whos_using/) from real-time gaming to banking and everything in between.
* Vert.x is not a restrictive framework or container and we don't tell you a correct way to write an application. Instead, we give you a lot of useful bricks and let you create your app the way you want to.
* Vert.x is fun - Enjoy being a developer again. Unlike restrictive traditional application containers, Vert.x gives you incredible power and agility to create compelling, scalable, 21st-century applications the way you want to, with a minimum of fuss, in the language you want.
* Vert.x is lightweight - Vert.x core is around 650kB in size.
* Vert.x is fast. Here are some independent [numbers](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r8&hw=i7&test=plaintext).
* Vert.x is **not an application server**. There's no monolithic Vert.x instance into which you deploy applications. You just run your apps wherever you want to.
* Vert.x is modular - when you need more bits just add the bits you need and nothing more.
* Vert.x is simple but not simplistic. Vert.x allows you to create powerful apps, simply.
* Vert.x is an ideal choice for creating light-weight, high-performance, microservices.

>**NOTE:** There are not enough time in this workshop to cover all aspects and benefits of Reactive, but you will learn the basics and experience some of the benefits.
